## Project Overview 
Road traffic crashes represent a major public safety and public health concern in Nigeria, resulting in thousands of injuries and fatalities each year. Despite continuous efforts by the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) to improve road safety, the persistence of these incidents highlights the need for a deeper understanding of their underlying causes and patterns. The FRSC has compiled detailed quarterly crash data covering the period from 2020 to 2024, encompassing critical variables such as the number of crashes, injuries, fatalities, vehicles involved, and key contributing factors — including speed violations, driver impairment, poor weather conditions, and fatigue.
The primary objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to analyse and identify trends, patterns, and key insights related to road traffic crashes across Nigeria’s states and quarters. Specifically, this analysis seeks to uncover temporal trends, evaluate state-by-state crash risks, and assess the impact of contributing factors on the severity of outcomes such as injuries and fatalities. By deriving data-driven insights, this study aims to support the FRSC in developing targeted road safety policies, prioritizing high-risk regions, and implementing evidence-based interventions to reduce crash rates and save lives.
